## Apache Hadoop, Pig and Hive Project
### Part A: WORDCOUNT
This project analyzes word frequency across 10 journals by Charles Dickens, a prominent Victorian author known for his rich vocabulary. The journals, sourced from Project Gutenberg, are merged into a single dataset to capture Dickens' writing style. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in his work, such as thematic focuses and language evolution. Utilizing Apache Pig and Apache Hive within a Hadoop ecosystem, the project preprocesses and queries the large dataset efficiently. Results are visualized using tools like Power BI, with outputs including word clouds, bar charts, and histograms to showcase frequently used words and linguistic characteristics in Dickens' writings.

#### Objectives
1. Perform a comprehensive word frequency analysis of 10 merged journals authored by Charles Dickens in order to identify writing style and recurrent themes throughout the literature
2. Pre-process, clean, and analyze a large volume of textual data using Apache Pig and Hive, demonstrating the capability of these tools in handling and analyzing big data.
3. Create visualizations using Power BI for the representations of word frequency data

### Part B: AIRLINES ON-TIME PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
This research analyzes airline on-time performance using a dataset from the 2009 Data Expo. The study investigates factors influencing flight delays, including travel time, aircraft age, weather conditions, and flight volume trends. By leveraging Apache Hive for large-scale data analysis, the project aims to determine optimal flight timings, the effect of aircraft age on punctuality, and weather impacts on delays. The dataset includes detailed flight records from October 1987 to April 2008. The analysis addresses key questions about airline delays and cancellations, with results presented through preprocessing, filtering, aggregation, and statistical measures.

#### Objectives
1. Identify and analyze the factors that contribute to flight delays and cancellations based on the dataset
2. Utilize Apache Hive to analyze and query airline performance data for the identification of trends and patterns related to flight delays, cancellations, and air traffic flow
3. Analyze the influence of weather conditions on flight delays and cancellations based on the dataset
